# 📰 Inshorts-Like-App

Are you a news junkie who likes to stay up-to-date with the latest happenings around the world? Check out this cool Inshorts-like news app built using Python Tkinter GUI and newsapi.org API! 🌎📈

This app follows the concept of OOPs and utilizes various libraries to fetch 20 short news snippets (from indexing 0 to 19) and display their headlines, along with a 20-50 word summary and an image related to the news.

But that's not all! You can also use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the articles, or click "Read More" to explore further.

Just be aware of one little snag - sometimes the image may not be available, leading to an error in the code. But no worries! We've implemented the TRY and EXCEPT method to handle this issue.

The complete code for the GUI app can be found in the "news_gui.py" file.

So, get ready to stay informed and entertained with our app! 📲💻
