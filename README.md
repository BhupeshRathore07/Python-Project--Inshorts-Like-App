# Inshorts-Like-App

This is small Inshorts like news app created using Python Tkinter GUI and API from newsapi.org.
In this concept of OOPs is also implemented and various libraries being used.

Basic idea here is, using news API getting 20 short news (from indexing 0 to 19) and showing their heading and 20-50 words of details alike Inshorts with relative image to the news.
This same idea can be implemented for multiple projects using various APIs. 

Also created three buttons for getting into "next", "previous" news or if user wanted to read more then "Read More" button.

Task here to take care of, is to get the image and if image isn't available then the code produces error. So as to remove this error, used the TRY and EXCEPT method for the image.

Here is the full code of the GUI app in "news_gui.py" file.
